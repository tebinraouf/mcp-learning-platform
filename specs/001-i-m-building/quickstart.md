```
Step 1: Deliberately fail a quiz (score <70%)
→ Action: Answer questions incorrectly to score below threshold
→ Verify: Quiz marked as failed, stage remains incomplete

Step 2: Review feedback
→ Verify: Specific feedback provided for incorrect answers
→ Verify: Recommended modules shown (two lowest-scoring concept areas)
→ Verify: Option to retake quiz is available

Step 3: Retake quiz after reviewing recommendations
→ Action: Review suggested modules, then retake quiz
→ Verify: Quiz attempt count increments
→ Verify: Can eventually pass after multiple attempts
```

### 7. Accessibility Validation

**Scenario**: Basic accessibility compliance check

```

Step 2: Screen reader compatibility (basic)
→ Action: Enable screen reader (VoiceOver/NVDA/JAWS)
→ Verify: Page structure announced correctly
→ Verify: Progress indicators announced as percentages
→ Verify: Quiz questions and options announced clearly

Step 3: Color contrast verification
→ Verify: Text contrast meets WCAG AA (4.5:1 normal text)
→ Verify: Interactive elements have sufficient contrast
→ Verify: Progress indicators distinguishable without color alone
```

### 8. Performance Validation

**Scenario**: Verify performance requirements

```
Step 1: Cold load performance (clear cache)
→ Action: Clear browser cache, reload page
→ Measure: Time to first interactive (should be <2.0s on 4G)
→ Verify: Above-fold content renders quickly (<1.2s meaningful paint)

Step 2: Bundle size check
→ Action: Open browser dev tools Network tab
→ Verify: Total JavaScript payload ≤180KB gzip
→ Verify: Critical CSS inline, non-critical assets lazy-loaded

Step 3: Navigation performance
→ Action: Navigate between stages and modules
→ Verify: Client-side routing feels instant (≤150ms perceived)
→ Verify: No unnecessary re-renders or layout shifts
```

### 9. Content Update Simulation

**Scenario**: Test update notification mechanism

```
Step 1: Simulate content update
→ Action: Manually update content version hash in sessionStorage
→ Reload page
→ Verify: "Updated" badge appears near knowledge map header

Step 2: Verify one-time notification
→ Action: Interact with app, navigate between pages
→ Verify: Badge appears only once per session
→ Verify: Badge disappears after acknowledgment/interaction
```

### 10. Edge Case Testing

**Scenario**: Validate error handling and edge cases

```
