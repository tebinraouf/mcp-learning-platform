# Feature Specification: Modern Educational MCP Learning App

**Feature Branch**: `001-i-m-building`  
**Created**: 2025-10-04  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "I'm building a modern MCP app to be educational on how MCP works and all details. it has a modern design. it has quizes. something that will be unique and standout. should have the initial page as the main page to dive deep into MCP. it should have stages of learnings."

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-04

- Q: What is the primary performance target for initial load on a mid‑range mobile device (cold load, fresh session, average 4G)? → A: Fast: First interactive < 2.0s, total JS ≤ 180KB gzip.
- Q: What level of telemetry / analytics is in scope for v1 (anonymous session-only app)? → A: Minimal: Aggregate session counters (stage starts, quiz passes) in-memory only, not persisted.
- Q: What is the localization / internationalization scope for v1? → A: English only; no i18n framework.
- Q: What is the expected cadence for updating embedded MCP learning content (stages, quizzes, concept text)? → A: Continuous: small updates as soon as authored (multiple per week).
- Q: How should users be informed that new embedded learning content is available after a rebuild? → A: Subtle badge: show a non-blocking "Updated" badge on the landing page knowledge map header (and next to any newly changed stage) on the user's next load only; no runtime polling or banners.

### Applied Outcomes

- Added non-functional performance acceptance criteria (initial interactive <2.0s, JS budget ≤180KB gzip, content meaningful paint goal <1.2s) to checklist.
- Planning implication: prioritize code splitting of visualization and knowledge map; defer loading quizzes until stage view.

## Execution Flow (main)

```text
1. Parse user description from Input
   → If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement must be testable
   → Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   → If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   → If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines

- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story

A learner interested in understanding the Model Context Protocol (MCP) visits the app. On the landing (initial) page they are immediately oriented with a visually engaging, modern overview of MCP concepts and can choose a structured learning path divided into progressive stages (Foundations → Architecture & Messages → Advanced Patterns → Building & Debugging → Mastery). The user can dive deep into any stage, take interactive quizzes to validate comprehension, and track progress visually. The experience differentiates itself through polished modern design, adaptive learning pacing, and unique MCP exploration tools (e.g., concept drilldowns, interactive message flow visualizations, stage-based unlocking, and a "Deep Dive" home panel that acts as both a dashboard and knowledge map).

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. Given a new visitor on the initial page, When they scroll or interact with primary calls-to-action, Then they can select a Stage to begin (starting with Foundations) and view its learning modules.
2. Given a learner who completes all quiz items in a stage with passing scores, When they finish the final quiz, Then the next stage becomes unlocked and their progress indicator updates.
3. Given a learner viewing the main page, When they click a concept in the MCP knowledge map (e.g., "Session Negotiation"), Then a deep dive panel opens summarizing the concept and suggesting related modules and a quiz (if available).
4. Given a partially completed stage, When the learner returns later, Then previously completed modules and quiz results are visibly marked and remaining prerequisites are clearly indicated.
5. Given a learner fails a quiz attempt, When they review feedback, Then they see which concepts to revisit and are offered targeted module links.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a learner abandons mid-quiz? → Progress for answered questions saved; quiz marked "incomplete". Partial credit NOT displayed until completion to avoid confusion.
- How does system handle absence of user account? → Anonymous session-based progress stored in sessionStorage; if session ends, progress resets (explicit reset also available).
- What if a stage depends on another not yet completed? → Provide locked state with prerequisite explanation.
- How are updated MCP concepts reflected for existing learners? → Content is embedded version; update replaces bundle; no historical versioning—user sees latest on refresh.
- How does system handle failed data retrieval for content? → All learning/quiz data embedded; offline mode loads from local bundled assets; if asset missing show inline fallback message: "Content temporarily unavailable. Please refresh."

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

- **NFR-PERF-003**: Non-critical visualizations (protocol flow, knowledge map) MUST lazy-load post first interactive and not block initial interactivity metric.
- **NFR-OBS-001**: System MUST maintain only in-memory aggregate counters (stage starts, quiz attempts, quiz passes) for current session; counters reset on session end and never transmitted or persisted.
- **NFR-I18N-001**: System MUST ship English-only static content; all user-facing strings hardcoded (no locale negotiation) in v1.
- **NFR-CONTENT-001**: Content update model is continuous; new builds may ship multiple times per week with no in-app version selector—users receive updated content on next full page load.
- **NFR-NOTIFY-001**: New content availability MUST be indicated passively: on first load after an updated build, display a one-time "Updated" badge near the knowledge map header (and beside any stage with modified modules) then suppress until a future build; MUST NOT use intrusive banners, modals, or background polling.
