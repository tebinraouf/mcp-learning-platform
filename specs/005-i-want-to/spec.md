# Feature Specification: GitHub Pages Deployment with CI/CD

**Feature Branch**: `005-i-want-to`  
**Created**: 2025-10-06  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "i want to deploy to github pages so that i can see it and share the link. i also want to deploy as i merge into main branch"

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → Extract: deploy to GitHub Pages, automatic deployment on merge to main
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Actors: developers, stakeholders
   → Actions: deploy, share, view
   → Constraints: trigger on main branch merge
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → No critical ambiguities identified
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → Scenario 1: Developer merges feature, site auto-deploys
   → Scenario 2: Stakeholder views live site
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → GitHub Pages configuration
   → CI/CD pipeline setup
   → Static export capability
6. Identify Key Entities
   → Deployment configuration, Build artifacts
7. Run Review Checklist
   → No implementation details in requirements
   → All requirements testable
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines

- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story

As a **developer or project stakeholder**, I want the application to be automatically deployed to a public URL whenever code is merged to the main branch, so that I can immediately see the latest changes and share the live application with others for review, testing, or demonstration purposes.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a feature branch has been developed and tested, **When** the branch is merged into main, **Then** the application is automatically built and deployed to GitHub Pages within 5 minutes

2. **Given** the deployment has completed successfully, **When** I visit the GitHub Pages URL, **Then** I see the latest version of the application with all merged changes

3. **Given** the application is deployed, **When** I share the GitHub Pages URL with stakeholders, **Then** they can access and interact with the live application without authentication

4. **Given** a deployment is in progress, **When** I check the repository's Actions tab, **Then** I can see the deployment status and any errors if the build fails

5. **Given** a deployment has failed, **When** I review the error logs, **Then** I can identify why the build or deployment failed and take corrective action

6. **Given** the application uses client-side routing, **When** users navigate to any route directly or refresh the page, **Then** the application loads correctly without 404 errors

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the build fails due to compilation errors?
  → Deployment should not proceed; error logs should be visible in GitHub Actions
  
- How does the system handle concurrent merges to main?
  → GitHub Actions should queue deployments sequentially

- What happens when someone accesses an old deployment URL after a new deployment?
  → The latest version should always be served at the main GitHub Pages URL

- How does the application handle browser caching of old assets?
  → Build process should include cache-busting mechanisms (e.g., hashed filenames)

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST automatically trigger a deployment workflow when code is merged to the main branch

- **FR-002**: System MUST build the application into static files suitable for GitHub Pages hosting

- **FR-003**: System MUST deploy the built static files to the GitHub Pages service under the repository's GitHub Pages URL

- **FR-004**: System MUST provide deployment status visibility through GitHub Actions interface showing success, failure, or in-progress states

- **FR-005**: System MUST make the deployed application accessible via HTTPS at the GitHub Pages URL without requiring authentication

- **FR-006**: System MUST preserve client-side routing functionality (users can directly access any route or refresh without 404 errors)

- **FR-007**: System MUST include cache-busting mechanisms to ensure users always receive the latest deployed version

- **FR-008**: System MUST fail the deployment gracefully if the build process encounters errors, without affecting the currently deployed version

- **FR-009**: Deployment workflow MUST complete within 10 minutes of merge to main branch under normal circumstances

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR-001**: Deployment process MUST be zero-downtime (existing deployment remains accessible until new deployment succeeds)

- **NFR-002**: GitHub Pages URL MUST be shareable and remain stable across deployments (no URL changes)

- **NFR-003**: Deployment logs MUST be accessible for at least 90 days for debugging purposes

- **NFR-004**: Build artifacts MUST include all necessary static assets (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, fonts)

### Key Entities

- **Deployment Configuration**: Settings that define how and when the application is deployed to GitHub Pages, including trigger conditions (main branch merge) and build steps

- **Build Artifacts**: The complete set of static files generated from the application source code, ready for hosting on GitHub Pages (HTML, CSS, JavaScript bundles, assets)

- **Deployment Workflow**: The automated process that executes on merge to main, encompassing build, test, and deployment steps with success/failure states

- **GitHub Pages Site**: The publicly accessible hosted application at the repository's GitHub Pages URL, serving the latest successfully deployed build artifacts

## Review & Acceptance Checklist

### Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

### Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous  
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

### Dependencies & Assumptions

- GitHub repository must have GitHub Pages enabled
- Repository must be public or organization must have GitHub Pages enabled for private repos
- Application must be capable of being built as static files (no server-side rendering requirements)
- Current application uses client-side routing that needs special handling for direct route access

---

## Execution Status

- [x] User description parsed
- [x] Key concepts extracted
- [x] Ambiguities marked (none found)
- [x] User scenarios defined
- [x] Requirements generated
- [x] Entities identified

## Success Metrics

- Deployment success rate >95% (successful deployments / total deployment attempts)
- Average deployment time <5 minutes from merge to live
- Zero downtime during deployments
- Deployment URL remains accessible 99.9% of the time

---

## Out of Scope

- Custom domain configuration (using default GitHub Pages domain)
- Preview deployments for pull requests (only main branch deployments)
- Rollback mechanism to previous deployments
- Deployment notifications (email, Slack, etc.)
- Performance optimization beyond static file hosting
- Analytics or monitoring integration
