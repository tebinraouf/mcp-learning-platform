**Feature Branch**: `003-once-a-learning`  
**Created**: October 5, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Once a learning path is complete, I want to set its status to complete and unlock the next learning path. this should happen if there is a passing score only."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Feature: Automatic stage progression based on quiz passing score
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: Learner
   ‚Üí Actions: Complete stage quiz, unlock next stage
   ‚Üí Data: Stage status, quiz score, passing threshold
   ‚Üí Constraints: Must have passing score
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí [RESOLVED] Passing score determined by existing quiz.passingThreshold
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí User completes quiz with passing score ‚Üí next stage unlocks
   ‚Üí User completes quiz with failing score ‚Üí next stage remains locked
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí All requirements are testable
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Stage, Quiz, QuizAttempt, Learner
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers
   ‚Üí No implementation details in spec
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a learner progressing through the MCP Learning Platform, when I complete a stage quiz with a passing score, the system should automatically mark that stage as complete and unlock the next stage in the sequence, allowing me to continue my learning journey without manual intervention.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a learner is on Stage 1 (Foundations) and the next stage (Architecture & Messages) is locked,  
   **When** the learner completes the Foundations quiz with a score of 75% (passing threshold is 70%),  
   **Then** the system marks Foundations as "completed" and unlocks Architecture & Messages stage (status changes from "locked" to "in-progress")

2. **Given** a learner is on Stage 1 (Foundations) and the next stage is locked,  
   **When** the learner completes the Foundations quiz with a score of 60% (below the 70% passing threshold),  
   **Then** the system keeps Foundations as "in-progress" and the next stage remains "locked"

3. **Given** a learner passes a quiz and the next stage is unlocked,  
   **When** the learner navigates to the dashboard,  
   **Then** the system displays the newly unlocked stage as accessible with visual indication

4. **Given** a learner is on the final stage (Mastery),  
   **When** the learner passes the final quiz,  
   **Then** the system marks Mastery as "completed" but does not attempt to unlock a non-existent next stage

5. **Given** a learner has failed a quiz previously,  
   **When** the learner retakes the quiz and achieves a passing score,  
   **Then** the system updates the stage to "completed" and unlocks the next stage

### Edge Cases

- **What happens when a learner retakes a quiz after passing?**  
  The stage remains "completed" and next stage remains unlocked. The system should not change existing progression status when retaking an already-passed quiz.

- **What happens if there is no next stage?**  
  The system should gracefully handle the completion of the final stage without attempting to unlock a non-existent stage. Display completion message or certificate.

- **What happens if a learner navigates away during a quiz?**  
  Quiz progress should be preserved in session storage. Stage progression only occurs upon successful quiz completion with passing score.

- **What happens when a learner has an incomplete quiz attempt?**  
  Incomplete quiz attempts should not trigger stage progression. Only completed quiz attempts with passing scores should unlock the next stage.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST evaluate quiz score against the stage's passing threshold immediately upon quiz completion

- **FR-002**: System MUST mark the current stage status as "completed" only when quiz score meets or exceeds the passing threshold

- **FR-003**: System MUST unlock the next sequential stage (change status from "locked" to "in-progress") only when the current stage quiz achieves a passing score

- **FR-004**: System MUST maintain the current stage status as "in-progress" when quiz score is below the passing threshold

- **FR-005**: System MUST preserve session storage data for stage statuses to persist progression within the browser session

- **FR-006**: System MUST handle the final stage completion by marking it as "completed" without attempting to unlock a non-existent next stage

- **FR-007**: System MUST display visual feedback indicating stage status changes (completed, unlocked) to the learner

- **FR-008**: System MUST allow learners to retake quizzes, with stage progression applying only on first passing attempt (subsequent retakes should not regress progression)

- **FR-009**: System MUST update the learner's progress dashboard to reflect newly completed and unlocked stages in real-time

- **FR-010**: System MUST log quiz completion and stage progression events for session analytics

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR-001**: Stage progression MUST occur immediately after quiz score calculation (< 100ms delay)

- **NFR-002**: Stage status updates MUST be atomic to prevent race conditions during concurrent quiz submissions

- **NFR-003**: System MUST gracefully handle network interruptions during quiz submission without losing progression state

### Key Entities

- **Stage**: Represents a learning stage with properties including:
  - Status: "locked", "in-progress", or "completed"
  - Sequence order: Determines which stage follows
  - Quiz: Associated quiz with passing threshold

- **Quiz**: Assessment for a stage containing:
  - Questions and correct answers
  - Passing threshold: Percentage required to pass (e.g., 70%)
  - Quiz ID: Links to parent stage

- **QuizAttempt**: Record of a learner's quiz attempt including:
  - Score: Percentage achieved (0-100%)
  - Completion status: Whether quiz was fully completed
  - Timestamp: When attempt occurred
  - Pass/Fail status: Derived from score vs. threshold

- **Learner**: User progressing through stages with:
  - Stage statuses: Map of stage IDs to current status
  - Quiz attempts: History of all quiz attempts
  - Session data: Current progress stored in session storage

### Business Rules

- **BR-001**: A stage can only be marked "completed" if its quiz achieves the passing threshold
- **BR-002**: The next stage in sequence can only be unlocked when the previous stage is marked "completed"
- **BR-003**: The first stage (Foundations) is always unlocked by default ("in-progress" status)
- **BR-004**: Stage progression is irreversible - a completed stage cannot be locked again
- **BR-005**: Multiple quiz attempts are allowed, but progression occurs only on first pass
- **BR-006**: All stage progression is session-based with no persistent storage or server-side state

## Success Metrics

- **Metric 1**: 100% of learners who achieve passing scores have their next stage automatically unlocked
- **Metric 2**: 0% of learners who fail a quiz have their next stage unlocked incorrectly
- **Metric 3**: Stage status updates occur within 100ms of quiz completion
- **Metric 4**: Zero data inconsistencies between quiz scores and stage statuses

## Assumptions & Constraints

### Assumptions
- Session storage is available and functional in the learner's browser
- Quiz passing thresholds are predefined for each stage
- Stages have a clear sequential order defined by `sequenceOrder` property
- Learners complete modules before attempting the stage quiz

### Constraints
- Session-only storage means progression is lost when browser is closed
- No user authentication or persistent accounts
- Single-user, single-session design
- Cannot unlock stages out of sequence (must follow linear path)

## Out of Scope

The following are explicitly NOT part of this feature:
- Persistent storage of learner progress across sessions
- User authentication or account creation
- Server-side progress tracking or APIs
- Certificate generation or completion badges
- Email notifications of stage completion
- Social features (sharing progress, leaderboards)
- Custom learning paths or skipping stages
- Admin controls for managing stage progression
- Analytics dashboard beyond session-level tracking
