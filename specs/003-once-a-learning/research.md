# Research: Stage Progression with Passing Score Requirement

**Feature**: 003-once-a-learning
**Date**: October 5, 2025
**Status**: Complete ✓

## Research Questions & Findings

### Q1: How does the existing `completeStage()` method work?

**Research Method**: Code analysis of `src/services/LearnerService.ts`

**Findings**:

```typescript
export function completeStage(stageId: StageId, nextStageId?: StageId): Learner {
    const current = getLearner()

    const updatedStatuses: Record<StageId, StageStatus> = {
        ...current.stageStatuses,
        [stageId]: 'completed',
    }

    // Unlock next stage if provided
    if (nextStageId) {
        updatedStatuses[nextStageId] = 'locked' // Will be set to in-progress when user clicks
    }

    return updateLearner({
        stageStatuses: updatedStatuses,
    })
}
```

**Critical Issue Identified**: The comment says "Will be set to in-progress when user clicks", but the requirement is for **automatic** progression. The next stage should be set to `'in-progress'`, not `'locked'`.

**Decision**: Fix `completeStage()` to set `nextStageId` status to `'in-progress'` instead of `'locked'`. This is the correct behavior for automatic unlocking.

**Rationale**: The spec (FR-003) states "unlock the next sequential stage (change status from 'locked' to 'in-progress')". Setting to 'locked' does not unlock - it keeps the stage locked.

### Q2: How is the next stage determined from the current stage?

**Research Method**: Code analysis of `src/types/index.ts` and `src/services/ContentService.ts`

**Findings**:

Stage interface includes:

```typescript
export interface Stage {
    id: StageId
    name: string
    sequenceOrder: number  // ← This determines progression order
    prerequisites: StageId[]
    // ...
}
```

ContentService provides:

```typescript
export function getAllStages(): Stage[]
export function getStage(stageId: StageId): Stage | undefined
```

**Current Stage Sequence** (from content/stages.ts):

1. `foundations` (sequenceOrder: 1)
2. `architecture-messages` (sequenceOrder: 2)
3. `advanced-patterns` (sequenceOrder: 3)
4. `building-debugging` (sequenceOrder: 4)
5. `mastery` (sequenceOrder: 5)

**Decision**: Create a helper function `getNextStageId(currentStageId)` that:

1. Loads all stages via `ContentService.getAllStages()`
2. Sorts stages by `sequenceOrder`
3. Finds the index of the current stage
4. Returns the next stage ID (or `undefined` for the final stage)

**Alternatives Considered**:

- ❌ Hardcoded mapping (fragile, requires updates when stages change)
- ❌ Using `prerequisites` array (backward-looking, not forward-looking)
- ✅ **Dynamic lookup by `sequenceOrder`** (flexible, maintainable)

### Q3: Where should the progression logic be called?

**Research Method**: Code analysis of `src/services/QuizService.ts`

**Findings**:

The `completeQuizAttempt()` function already:

```typescript
export function completeQuizAttempt(
    attempt: QuizAttempt,
    quiz: Quiz
): QuizAttempt {
    const totalQuestions = quiz.questions.length
    const correctAnswers = attempt.answers.filter((a) => a.isCorrect).length
    const score = correctAnswers / totalQuestions
    const passed = score >= quiz.passingThreshold  // ← Key decision point

    const completedAttempt: QuizAttempt = {
        ...attempt,
        score,
        passed,
    }

    // Update learner quiz counters
    const learner = LearnerService.getLearner()
    // ... counter updates ...

    // Store attempt
    learner.quizAttempts.push(completedAttempt)
    StorageService.saveLearner(learner)

    return completedAttempt
}
```

**Decision**: Add progression logic immediately after determining `passed === true`, before returning the attempt.

**Rationale**:

- This function already has access to `quiz.stageId` and `passed` status
- It already updates learner state via `LearnerService`
- It's the single point where quiz completion is finalized
- No UI logic - keeps business logic in service layer

**Alternatives Considered**:

- ❌ UI component (violates separation of concerns)
- ❌ Separate "progression" service (over-engineering for simple feature)
- ✅ **Enhance existing `QuizService.completeQuizAttempt()`** (minimal change, clear responsibility)

### Q4: What happens for the final stage (Mastery)?

**Research Method**: Spec analysis (FR-006) and edge case consideration

**Specification Requirement**:
> FR-006: System MUST handle the final stage completion by marking it as "completed" without attempting to unlock a non-existent next stage

**Findings**:

- The last stage (`mastery`, sequenceOrder: 5) has no next stage
- `getNextStageId('mastery')` should return `undefined`
- `LearnerService.completeStage(stageId, undefined)` should handle this gracefully

**Decision**:

1. `getNextStageId()` returns `undefined` when no next stage exists
2. `completeQuizAttempt()` calls `completeStage(currentStageId, nextStageId)` even when `nextStageId` is undefined
3. `completeStage()` already handles `undefined` nextStageId (it just marks current stage as completed)

**Rationale**: No special case code needed - existing method signature supports this via optional parameter.

---

### Q5: What about quiz retakes after passing?

**Research Method**: Spec analysis (BR-005, Edge Cases) and existing code review

**Specification Requirements**:

- BR-005: "Multiple quiz attempts are allowed, but progression occurs only on first pass"
- Edge Case: "The system should not change existing progression status when retaking an already-passed quiz"

**Current Behavior Analysis**:

- `stageStatuses` are stored in learner profile (session storage)
- Once a stage is marked 'completed', it stays 'completed'
- `completeStage()` overwrites the status to 'completed' (idempotent)

**Decision**: No special handling needed. Progression logic will run on every pass, but:

- Calling `completeStage(stageId, nextStageId)` on an already-completed stage is safe (idempotent)
- Setting a stage to 'in-progress' when it's already 'in-progress' is safe (no-op)
- No need to check "is this the first pass?" - just execute progression

**Rationale**: Idempotent operations are simpler and more robust than stateful "first pass" tracking.

## Technology Decisions

### Programming Language

**Decision**: TypeScript 5.7 (strict mode)
**Rationale**: Existing codebase language, no new dependencies needed

### Testing Framework

**Decision**: Jest + React Testing Library
**Rationale**: Already configured and used for existing service tests

### Storage Mechanism

**Decision**: SessionStorage via existing `StorageService`
**Rationale**: No changes needed - all persistence already handled

## Best Practices Applied

### TypeScript Best Practices

- Use existing type definitions (no new types needed)
- Maintain strict null checks for optional parameters
- Leverage existing type guards and validation

### Service Layer Best Practices

- Keep business logic in services, not UI
- Use pure functions where possible (no side effects beyond storage)
- Follow existing patterns (QuizService → LearnerService → StorageService)

### Testing Best Practices

- Test happy path (pass → progression)
- Test failure path (fail → no progression)
- Test edge cases (final stage, retakes)
- Use existing mocking patterns (uuid, StorageService)

## Dependencies & Integration Points

### Service Dependencies

```
QuizService (modified)
  ↓ calls
ContentService.getAllStages() (existing, read-only)
  ↓ calls
LearnerService.completeStage() (modified - bug fix)
  ↓ calls
StorageService.saveLearner() (existing, no changes)
```

### No External Dependencies

- ✅ No new npm packages required
- ✅ No API calls needed
- ✅ No database changes
- ✅ No configuration updates

## Performance Considerations

### Computational Complexity

- `getNextStageId()`: O(n log n) where n=5 stages → ~10 operations
- `completeStage()`: O(1) object property updates
- **Total overhead**: <1ms on modern browsers

### Storage Impact

- No new data stored (reuses existing `stageStatuses`)
- No increase in session storage size

### User Experience Impact

- Progression happens synchronously (no loading states)
- UI updates reactively (components already listen to learner state)
- Target: <100ms total (easily achievable)

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk

- ✅ Small code change (<20 lines)
- ✅ Reuses existing, tested services
- ✅ No UI changes required
- ✅ Backward compatible (doesn't break existing functionality)

### Medium Risk

- ⚠️ Bug fix in `completeStage()` affects existing behavior
  - **Mitigation**: Update tests to verify new behavior

### No High Risk Items

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Manual Stage Unlocking (Status Quo)

**Rejected**: Doesn't meet user requirement "I want to set its status to complete and unlock the next learning path"

### Alternative 2: Server-Side Progression Logic

**Rejected**: App is client-side only, no backend infrastructure

### Alternative 3: React Context for Progression

**Rejected**: Over-engineering; existing service layer is sufficient and proven

### Alternative 4: Dedicated ProgressionService

**Rejected**: Single responsibility already exists in LearnerService

## Conclusion

**All research questions answered ✓**

**Key Decisions**:

1. Fix `completeStage()` to set next stage to 'in-progress' (not 'locked')
2. Create `getNextStageId()` helper using dynamic `sequenceOrder` lookup
3. Enhance `completeQuizAttempt()` with progression logic when `passed === true`
4. No special case handling needed (existing code handles edge cases)
